# train-scheduler
Overview

This assignment is a train schedule application that uses Firebase to display arrival and departure data in real time. This app will retrieve and update this information dynamically with Moment.js. This website will calculate how many minutes the train will arrive at the station depending on their arrival times and frequency.
